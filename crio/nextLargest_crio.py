Problem Description
Given an array A having N elements, the task is to find the next greater element for each element of the array in order of their 
appearance in the array. If no such element exists, output -1.

Input format
The first line contains an integer N denoting the size of the array. The second line contains N space separated positive integers denoting the values in the array A.

Output format
Print N space separated integers, which are the next greater element for each array element. If no such greater element exists for any element, output -1

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^5

0 <= Values in the array <= 10^9

Sample Input 1
4

1 3 2 4

Sample Output 1
3 4 4 -1

Explanation 1
In the array, the next larger element to 1 is 3 , 3 is 4 , 2 is 4 and for 4, there is no such greater element, hence -1
