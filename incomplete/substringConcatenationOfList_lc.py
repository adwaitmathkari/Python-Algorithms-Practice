https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/


You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. 
Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words 
exactly once and without any intervening characters.

Example 1:
Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.

Example 2:
Input:
  s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
  words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []
