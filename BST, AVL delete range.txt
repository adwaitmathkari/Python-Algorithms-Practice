Describe how to perform an operation remove range(start, stop) that removes all the items whose 
keys fall within range(start, stop) in a sorted map that is implemented with a binary search tree T, 
and show that this method runs in time O(s+h), where s is the number of items removed and h is the 
height of T (Use Python if provide pseudo-code).

Repeat the previous problem (Python for possible pseudo-code) using an AVL tree, 
achieving a running time of O(s log n). Why doesnâ€™t the solution to the previous problem 
trivially result in an O(s+logn) algorithm for AVL trees?
