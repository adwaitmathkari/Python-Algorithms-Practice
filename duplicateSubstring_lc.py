"""
Given a string S, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of S that occur 2 or more times.  (The occurrences may overlap.)

Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length.  (If S does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is "".)

 
Example 1:

Input: "banana"
Output: "ana"
Example 2:

Input: "abcd"
Output: ""
 

Note:

2 <= S.length <= 10^5
S consists of lowercase English letters.
